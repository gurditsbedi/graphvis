# graphvis

This is a simple in-browser app to display graph(graph theory). This app is built to aid in "Competitive Coding" graph and tree problems.

Here are few thing regarding to the app:

* There is app is not perfect in terms of looks or aesthetics. This serves a small purpose not more than that.

* Visualization of a graph having around 20 vertices seems to be appropiate for the current window size provided by the app. The window size can be increased.

* This app is developed using [greuler](https://maurizzzio.github.io/greuler/#/)  (has further dependencies) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)  .
